Very simple speech recognition software, using the speech recognition library
along with the spotipy library to play your favourite songs simply by saying an assigned word.

Client ID and Client secret can be found by creating an app using the Spotify for Developers webpage:

                              https://developer.spotify.com/

Once logged in to your spotify account you are able to build an app, ensure to match your app with 
the redirect URI in the code.

- IMPORTANT: spotify has to be open and in some cases already playing a song to be sent a token.
